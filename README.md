# Exploring attention-based models for classification of pro-eating disorder users on Twitter

In this project we fine-tune the pre-trained attention-based models BERT, ALBERT and DisilBERT and compare it to a baseline SVM classifier on the multiclass task of classifying pro-eating disorder users on Twitter.

To set up project using the correct Python packages, run this command

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
